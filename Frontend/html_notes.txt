What DOCTYPE do you use and why? - Interview Question.
  What works best for you depends on what your situation is.

  If you want your HTML page to work correctly on very very old browsers that don't support <!DOCTYPE html> (and yes, there were such browsers, like Netscape 6) then the strict doctype is really the only possibility.

  If you want your HTML page to validate, AND you must, for some reason that you don't want to reveal, use elements like <center> or <font> or <u>, then transitional is the doctype of choice.

  However, those are really edge cases, and you should consider forgetting about them. In the majority of cases, <!DOCTYPE html> will do. Don't look to the past; look to the future.


What is the difference between name and id on form documents?
  Id is used to identify the HTML element through the Document Object Model (via Javascript or styled with CSS). Id is expected to be unique within the page. Name corresponds to the form element and identifies what is posted back to the server.Sep 9, 2009
